# Woozle

A collection of mini-games implemented in Java.

### Motivations

Woozle was originally created (a few years ago in Java 4) as a demo/exploration project that would
eventually be converted to an Android-based game for smartphones. As such, the applications display
is currently locked at 320x240.

### What's included?

Currently this demo is composed of four mini-games; including popular games like Breakout, Reversi, and Hangman.
